# note col1 'page' , col2 'price', col3 'order'

# PAGE indicates the stage of the user's journey through the e-commerce website.
# Typically, Page 5 could represent a checkout or purchase confirmation page, which is the last step in the process before completing the purchase.
# If the user reaches Page 5, it strongly suggests that they are finalizing the purchase.


#  The PRICE column indicates the price of the product being viewed or purchased.
# If PRICE > 0, it confirms that the user interacted with a product that has a valid price.
# If PRICE == 0, it might be a non-purchasable item or a placeholder product view.
# If PRICE > 0, it suggests a real product interaction and increases the likelihood of a purchase event.


# 3. row['ORDER'] > 10
# Reasoning: ORDER represents the sequence of clicks during a session.
# The higher the ORDER value, the longer and more engaged the session.
# ORDER <= 10 could mean the user browsed briefly and left without purchasing.
# ORDER > 10 suggests a deeper level of engagement, indicating the user is more likely to complete a purchase.
# Why > 10?
# Thresholds like 10 are chosen based on domain knowledge or empirical analysis.
# For example, in clickstream data, a session with more than 10 clicks often signifies serious interest and intent to purchase, especially if it ends at PAGE 5.
